Description: pi-top [4] Display Port Support
 This is a dummy package that includes packages that manage kernel modules,
 udev rules and system configuration (such as a DHCP server) to allow
 plug-and-play network connections (such as SSH and VNC) with a pi-top [4]
 via its USB-OTG connection from the Raspberry Pi's USB-C port.
